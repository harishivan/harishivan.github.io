## 🚀 What I Build

### 🟢 Real-Time Industrial AI Monitoring Platform  
**Problem:** Engineers struggle to detect anomalies early.  
**Solution:** Built an end-to-end AI system using MQTT ↔ FastAPI ↔ TimescaleDB → ML-driven alerts.  
**Impact:** Reduced undetected anomalies & improved test reliability.

### 🔍 AI Log Intelligence System  
Used NLP + machine learning to analyze system logs and generate predictive insights, fast root cause summaries & trend analytics.

### 💡 Enterprise GenAI Assistant  
Designed a GenAI assistant with safety guardrails for enterprise knowledge retrieval and task automation.
